## Overview
In this project, we first assigned different tasks to each member. After finishing the independent tasks, we held two group meetings (a total of 6+ hours) with full attendance. During the meetings, we discussed the logic of each implementation and the possible problems as well as bugs. Then we started to implement unit-test together and made sure our code passed all the tests before the meeting ended.
